#php_findandreplace

####By Aundra Miller and Ronando Long

## Description
This is a simple PHP project to become familiar with writing PHP code using Silex routing, Twig templates, and PHPUnit testing. Users first enter a word or phrase into a form. Then they enter a word they want to target and what they want to replace it with. The function returns the adjusted input.

**This application may not be complete. Its sole purpose was to be a class exercise.**
